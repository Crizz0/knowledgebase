## [1.1.0] - 2021-08-16

### Added
- A preview function for the `postÂ´ and `edit` modes
- Inserted an additional column into the `KB_ARTICLES` table to hold the username of the last user who edited an article
- The logging of editing an article
- The `composer.json` file according to new version
- Changed the use of `sizeof()` to `count()` in `controller/admin_controller.php` and `controller/main_controller.php`

### Changed
- The `composer.json` file according to new version and update developer
- Added to all language variables a `KB_` prefix or `_KNOWLEDGEBASE_` part to avoid problems with other extensions or phpBB core code.

### Fixed
-	Wrong order of `public` and `static` specifiers in `event/listener.php` and in `migrations/v10x/release_0_0_1.php`
-	Usage of `$this->user->data['session_ip']` instead of `$this->user->data['user_ip']` which led to an empty string in `controller/main_controller.php`
-	The undefined index `cat_name` to `category_name` in `controller/admin_controller.php`, line 760

### Removed
-	Unnecessary `use` statement in `migrations/v10x/release_0_0_1.php`
